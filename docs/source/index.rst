Welcome to galob's documentation!
=================================

Genetic algorithm for load balancing (galob) is a tool that allocates
runnables with interdependencies to processing units, taking into account both
load balancing and any communication overhead regarding load parallelism.

Galob is the outcome of an assignment of the course **Distributed and Parallel
Systems** on the first semester (winter semester of 2016/17) of the Master's
program **Embedded Systems for Mechatronics**.
